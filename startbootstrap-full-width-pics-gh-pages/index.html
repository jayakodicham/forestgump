        <p>This is a pivotal scene in the film because it transitions from Forrest’s restricted past as a young boy to his open future as a young man. As the audience sees this physical transition into older Forrest, we see him running again from bullies but this time runs across a football field, prompting the coach to find him to join the team at the University of Alabama.</p>

Because Forrest is wearing leg braces, the dancing is jolted and odd, however Forrest and Mrs. Gump later see Elvis impersonating Forrest’s dancing while singing “Hound Dog” on television.</p>
        <p>This scene is significant to connect Forrest’s story to America in the 1950s, especially to understanding cultural events like the emergence of rock and roll and icons like Elvis Presley.</p>

The US table tennis team visited several cities in China in 1971, including Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.The team's visit was part of a historic event known as "ping pong diplomacy". Ping-pong diplomacy was a key part of Richard Nixon's plan to establish detente with China.

        <br>Forrest's Home<br>
        <p>Forrest begins his narrative by talking about his childhood in Greenbow, Alabama. He was born on June 6, 1944, the day of the Normandy landings during World War II. Raised by a single mother because his father was “on vacation,” she named him after a Civil War Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was also first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and a supposed ancestor of Gump's. Greenbow is a central location in the film, not only as an important place in Forrest’s life, but also culturally as part of the American south as well.</p>
        <p>Growing up in the American south during the timeline of the film is important because of the political, cultural, and economic correlations to historical events depicted in the film. From Forrest’s upbringing to his understanding of things that happen throughout the film shows how a particular geographical location can help shape an individual and their values or beliefs. From being a part of the segregation at schools, to befriending Bubba, or fighting in the Vietnam War, Forrest uses his upbringing to support him as he moves through the challenges in his life. </p>

            <p> In the film’s rendition of this moment in history, one of President Kennedy’s final acts before his assassination was meeting the National Champion football team from the University of Alabama, which included Forrest Gump.</p>
        <p>President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. It was especially alarming as it happened on live television. It and the news coverage following changed broadcasting news forever. Snider (2021) notes, “The death of President Kennedy was more than mourning the loss of a world leader, it was losing someone the whole world believed could make great change, and get them one step closer to world peace.”</p>
