Assuming that their lights had gone out due to a loss of power, he calls the Watergate office to tell them about it, and security guard Frank Wills responds, implying that Forrest set the stage for the scandal to be discovered. News footage of Nixon announcing his resignation is shown in the film.</p>
        <p>The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon, which began in 1972 and ultimately led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. It revolved around members of a group associated with Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign breaking into and planting listening devices in the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972, and Nixon's later attempts to hide his administration's involvement.</p>

        <br>Forrest's Home<br>
        <p>Forrest begins his narrative by talking about his childhood in Greenbow, Alabama. He was born on June 6, 1944, the day of the Normandy landings during World War II. Raised by a single mother because his father was “on vacation,” she named him after a Civil War Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was also first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and a supposed ancestor of Gump's. Greenbow is a central location in the film, not only as an important place in Forrest’s life, but also culturally as part of the American south as well.</p>
        <p>Growing up in the American south during the timeline of the film is important because of the political, cultural, and economic correlations to historical events depicted in the film. From Forrest’s upbringing to his understanding of things that happen throughout the film shows how a particular geographical location can help shape an individual and their values or beliefs. From being a part of the segregation at schools, to befriending Bubba, or fighting in the Vietnam War, Forrest uses his upbringing to support him as he moves through the challenges in his life. </p>

        <p>President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. It was especially alarming as it happened on live television. It and the news coverage following changed broadcasting news forever.
